## The Inspiration Behind the Project

The project was inspired by my dog, Zascha, a 6-year-old golden border retriever that we adopted from a shelter. My fascination with her parent breeds and cross-breeds during my teenage years led to the idea of creating the web application. Originally considering a stock market-related app, I came across IdeaDog (which had nothing to do with dogs funnily enough), inspiring me to develop a platform for connecting people interested in cross-breeding their dogs.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions
### Frontend and Backend Technologies
- **Frontend:** The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Flask templates for server-side rendering.
- **Backend:** Powered by Python, the Flask framework, and MySQL for database management.
- **Real-time Communication:** Implemented Socket.IO for real-time chat functionality.
- **External Services:** Google Maps API integration enhances location-based features.
### Struggles and Learning Moments
Encountering anticipated challenges during the project, time constraints led to the exclusion of certain functionalities, such as an extensive dashboard for professional breeders and a different chatroom for users and breeders. The most demanding aspect was implementing the chatroom functionality using socket.io, involving multiple database tables, Flask routes, JavaScript methods, and jQuery. As the sole contributor, I navigated various online resources and used AI to comprehend and address these concepts. Micro-adjustments to the code were crucial in resolving issues, and a small workaround ensured dynamic message loading in the chatroom. Another hurdle involved CSS styling without frameworks, requiring extensive development and adjustments for visual appeal. Overall, bug fixing emerged as the most challenging technical aspect of the project.
